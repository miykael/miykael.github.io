I am a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer and Neuroscientist** developing advanced models and processing pipelines in neuroimaging, computer vision, vital signs monitoring, AR/VR, and multi-sensor sensing. With a strong background in biomedical signals, constrained optimization, and statistical inference, I create automated, adaptive processing pipelines that maximize efficiency from cutting-edge hardware and software. Passionate about applying machine learning to deliver impactful end-user experiences, I smoothly collaborate with cross-functional teams within and outside of the company to translate complex research into robust, scalable solutions.

With a knack for quality, efficiency, and transparency, I **am experienced** in working on challenging projects, both as a team member and project leader. Leading technical projects with autonomy and precision, I tackle complex challenges in high-stakes environments, minimizing computational and energy costs while maximizing AI impact. My expertise extends to crafting innovative toolboxes, mentoring, and leading proof-of-concept projects across sectors like medicine, manufacturing, semiconductors, and optical solutions. Collaborating with stakeholders from academia and industry, I apply my insights and methods with precision and adaptability.
